diff between UMA and NUMA

-----IMPORTANT FOR THE EXAMS-----

i:  difference between 

CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer)                     RISC (Reduced ------)
-> It has microprogramming unit                             -> It has hard wired programming unit
-> the Instruction set has various different Instruction    -> the Instruction set is reduced and the Instruction 
that is used for complex operations                            are primitive
-> The performance is optimised with impact on hardware     -> ----- on software
->It has single register set                                -> it has multiple registers
-> they are less or non pipline                             -> they are highly pipline
-> execution time is high                                   -> low
-> code expansion is easily done                            -> cannot be done
-> the coding of Instruction is complex                     -> the coding is simple
-> It requires external memory for calculations             -> doesnot require external memory
-> Single cycle for each Instruction                        -> Instruction can have several clock cycle
-> Heavy use of RAM                                         -> Efficient use of RAM
-> Simple and standard instructions                         -> complex and variable lenght instructions
-> limited addressing mode                                  -> compound addressing mode
-> varying formats                                          -> fixed 32 bit formats
-> single cache for instructions and data                   -> separate cache for -----
->It can be  used in security system or in HOME             -> it is used in smartphones
automations
-> example: intel                                           -> alpha and sarc
