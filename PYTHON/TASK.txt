Worksheet 2.3:

1. write a python program to filter a dictionary based on values
Original dictionary: {'CN': 17, 'COA': 15, 'SE': 16}
Marks greater than 16: {'CN': 17}

2. WPP to create a dictionary grouping a sequence of key-value pair into dictionary of lists
Original list: [('Yellow', 1), ('Blue', 2), ('Yellow', 5), ('Red', 1)]
Grouping sequence of key- value pairs into dictionary of list:
{'Yellow': [1,3], 'Blue': [2,4], 'red': [1]}

3. Generate and print a dictionary that contain a number (b/w 1 and n) in for as sample input and output
Input number: 8
Output: {1:-1, 2:2, 3:7, 4: 14, 5:23, 6:34, 7:47, 8:62}

4. WPP to convert a dictionary into list of lists 
Original dictionary: {[1:'CSE'],[ 2:'EE'], [3:'ECE'],[ 4:'ME'], [5,'Civil']}
Convert dictionary into list of lists: [[1, 'CSE'], [2, 'EE], [3, 'ECE'], [4, 'ME'], [5, 'Civil']]

5. Given dictionary in python, write PP to find sum of all items in the dictionary.
Input: {'x':25, 'y':18, 'z': 45}
Output: 88
